                One day fourteen-year-old Sophie Amundsen comes home from school to find in her mailbox two notes, with one question on each: "Who are you?" and "Where does the world come from?"
                From that irresistible beginning, Sophie becomes obsessed with questions that take her far beyond what she knows of her Norwegian village. 
                Through those letters, she enrolls in a kind of correspondence course, covering Socrates to Sartre, with a mysterious philosopher, while receiving letters addressed to another girl. 
                Who is Hilde? And why does her mail keep turning up?
                To unravel this riddle, Sophie must use the philosophy she is learning―but the truth turns out to be far more complicated than she could have imagined.

                Paulo Coelho's masterpiece tells the mystical story of Santiago, an Andalusian shepherd boy who yearns to travel 
                in search of a worldly treasure. His quest will lead him to riches far different—and far more satisfying—than 
                he ever imagined. Santiago's journey teaches us about the essential wisdom of listening to our hearts,
                of recognizing opportunity and learning to read the omens strewn along life's path, and, most importantly, to follow our dreams.
