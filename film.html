            <h4>About Film</h4>
            
            <p>When a successful New York advertising executive suffers a great tragedy he retreats from life.<b>While his concerned friends try desperately to reconnect with him, he seeks answers from the universe by writing letters to Love, Time and Death.</b> 
            But it's not until his notes bring unexpected personal responses that he begins to understand how these constants interlock in a life fully lived, and how even the deepest loss can reveal moments of meaning and beauty.</p>
